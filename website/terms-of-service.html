                    <p><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not transfer or assign your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without V-Kare's written permission. V-Kare may transfer its rights or obligations to another company if needed for a business reason (like a merger or sale).</p>
                    <p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will still apply.</p>
                    <p><strong>No Waiver:</strong> If V-Kare does not enforce a part of these Terms, it does not mean V-Kare gives up the right to enforce it later.</p>
                    <p><strong>Survival:</strong> Any part of these Terms that, by their nature, should continue after your use of V-Kare ends will continue to apply.</p>
                    <p><strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> These Terms are just between you and V-Kare. No one else has any rights under these Terms.</p>
                    <p>For clarity, V-Kare is not a healthcare provider, does not provide licensed therapy, counseling, diagnosis, or treatment. No medical or clinical relationship is created. V-Kare is not a substitute for professional care. Nothing stated, posted, or made available through V-Kare is intended to be, and must not be taken to be, the practice of medicine or the provision of medical care.</p>
